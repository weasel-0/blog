    Just my luck, no ice. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your
    dinosaur tour, right? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? This thing comes
    fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
    You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas.
    Do you need a manager?

    So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Remind me to thank John for a lovely
    weekend. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Just my luck, no ice. You
    know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Just my luck, no
    ice. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!
